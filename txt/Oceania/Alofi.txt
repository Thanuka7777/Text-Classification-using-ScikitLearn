Alofi is the capital of the Pacific Ocean island nation of Niue, which is located within the Realm of New Zealand. With a population of 1,611 (census of 2011), Alofi has the distinction of being the second smallest national capital city in terms of population (after Ngerulmud, capital of Palau). It consists of the two villages: Alofi North and Alofi South where the government headquarters are located.[4]It is located at the centre of Alofi Bay on the west coast of the island, close to the only break in the coral reef that surrounds Niue. The bay stretches for 30% of the island's length (about seven kilometres) from Halagigie Point in the south to Makapu Point in the north. It is also notable that Alofi contains the world's largest toothbrush fence.In January 2004, Niue was hit by the fierce tropical storm Cyclone Heta which killed two people and did extensive damage to the entire island. Many of Alofi's buildings were destroyed, including the hospital. Government buildings were shifted to a less exposed site 3 km (1.9 mi) inland from the west coast, named Fonuakula, after the storm.[6] This site is still within the village boundaries of Alofi South.Alofi features a tropical rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification, with no discernible dry season. The city has a noticeably drier stretch from June through September. However, all of these months average more than 60 mm (2.4 in) of rain, the limit for a dry season month. Like other cities with this climate, average temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year, at 25 °C (77 °F).The town is serviced by Niue International Airport, and there are numerous roads, both paved and dirt, that crisscross the town.[7]Coordinates: 19°03′S 169°54′W﻿ / ﻿19.05°S 169.9°W﻿ / -19.05; -169.9
