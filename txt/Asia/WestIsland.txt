West Island is the capital of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The population is roughly 120. It is the less populous of the two inhabited islands (the other is Home Island). It was part of the Clunies-Ross plantation and an airstrip was built here during World War II. As well as all the government buildings, it contains the airport, a general store and tourist accommodation. In November 2013 it was revealed that the Australian Signals Directorate operates a listening station on West Island.[1]Coordinates: 12°11′13″S 96°49′42″E﻿ / ﻿12.18694°S 96.82833°E﻿ / -12.18694; 96.82833
