The Government Hill is a hill in Central, Hong Kong, bounded by upper section of Upper Albert Road on the south, Queen's Road Central north, Garden Road east, and Glenealy, west of Hong Kong Island.The hill has been the administrative centre of Hong Kong since the early days of British colonial rule, and has remained so after the transfer of sovereignty. The Government House, residence of chief executive and colonial governor, and the Former Central Government Offices (Government Headquarters), occupied large portion of the hill.St. John's Cathedral of the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui, the Anglican Church in Hong Kong, is also on the Government Hill. Adjacent to it is the Court of Final Appeal, inside the Former French Mission Building, with Battery Path leading to Queen's Road Central.Beside the already crowded central business district, the hill is free from skyscrapers and preserved many century-old trees. Higher up the hill in the south is Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.In 2011, an application was made to the Town Planning Board to rezone the area as Historic, and cap the building heights to the height of the existing buildings.[1]Coordinates: 22°16′44″N 114°09′34″E﻿ / ﻿22.27889°N 114.15944°E﻿ / 22.27889; 114.15944
