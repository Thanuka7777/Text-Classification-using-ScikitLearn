Flying Fish Cove is the main settlement of Australia's Christmas Island. Although it was originally named after British survey-ship Flying-Fish, many maps simply label it “The Settlement”.[1] It was the first British settlement on the island, established in 1888.About a third of the territory's total population of 1,600 lives in Flying Fish Cove, which lies near the north-eastern tip of the island. There is a small harbour which serves tourists with yachts. It is possible to dive at the settlement's beach.[2]Coordinates: 10°25′18″S 105°40′41″E﻿ / ﻿10.42167°S 105.67806°E﻿ / -10.42167; 105.67806
