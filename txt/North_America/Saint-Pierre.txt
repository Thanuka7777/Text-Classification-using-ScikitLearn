Saint-Pierre is the capital of the French overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada. Saint-Pierre is the more populated of the two communes (municipalities) making up Saint Pierre and Miquelon.The commune of Saint-Pierre is made up of the island of Saint-Pierre proper and several nearby smaller islands, such as L'Île-aux-Marins. Although containing nearly 90% of the inhabitants of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the commune of Saint-Pierre is considerably smaller than the commune of Miquelon-Langlade, which lies to its northwest.The main settlement and communal seat is situated on the north side of a harbour called Barachois, which faces the Atlantic Ocean, on the Saint-Pierre Island's east coast. The mouth of the harbour is guarded by a small chain of islands.Until 1945, there existed a third commune in Saint Pierre and Miquelon: L'Île-aux-Marins. The commune of L'Île-aux-Marins was annexed by the commune of Saint-Pierre in 1945.Population of Saint-Pierre at the 2006 local census was 5,888,[1] many of whom are of Basque, Breton, Normand or Acadian descent. All inhabitants in the commune (municipality) live on the island of Saint-Pierre proper.The commune is led by a mayor and a council.Close to the centre of the harbour's edge lie the Post office and Custom House, behind which is General Charles de Gaulle Square, the town's centre.Other prominent landmarks in Saint-Pierre include the cathedral, to the north of the square, rebuilt in the early twentieth century after a major fire, and the Pointe aux Canons Lighthouse, at the mouth of the harbour. Further north, close to the town's former hospital, is the Fronton Zazpiak Bat - an arena for the traditional Basque sport of pelota.General Charles de Gaulle SquareThe Cathedral in Saint-PierrePointe aux Canons Lighthouse in Saint PierreFronton Zazpiak Bat arena in Saint-PierreSaint-Pierre Airport, the international airport of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, is located south of the settlement of Saint-Pierre and is served by Air Saint-Pierre with flights both to Miquelon Airport and five Canadian airports.
