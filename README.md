In this python file, I demonstrated using BeautifulSoup to scrap texts from Wikipedia website. 

A crude workflow process is as follows:
1. Create a soup object using URL of the website;
2. Find the right tag by inspecting element of the webpage.
3. Use findAll() function to traserve down to the tag level
4. Get texts, titles, etc by specifying IDs
